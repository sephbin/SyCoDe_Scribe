The **chicken or the egg** [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") [dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma "Dilemma") is commonly stated as the question, "which came first: the [chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken "Chicken") or the [egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology) "Egg (biology)")?" The dilemma stems from the observation that all chickens hatch from eggs and all chicken eggs are laid by chickens. "Chicken-and-egg" is a metaphoric adjective describing situations where it is not clear which of two events should be considered the _cause_ and which should be considered the _effect_, to express a scenario of [infinite regress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_regress "Infinite regress"), or to express the difficulty of sequencing actions where each seems to depend on others being done first.
